    <h3>TEACHING OBJECTIVES</h3>
    <p>Student Academic Growth: The tangible achievement of seeing students demonstrate measurable progress, overcome learning challenges, and achieve their academic goals, whether big or small.

Student Personal Development: Witnessing students grow into confident, articulate, and responsible individuals who believe in their own abilities and have a strong sense of self-worth.

Inspired and Engaged Learners: The profound achievement of seeing a previously disinterested student become curious, or watching a class passionately debate a topic you introduced, showing they are truly engaged.

Positive Contribution to the Community [1]: Shaping thoughtful, informed, and ethical citizens who contribute positively to their classroom, school, and the wider community.

Strong Parental and Community Partnerships: Building trusting, collaborative relationships with families and community members to create a strong support network for student success.

Mastery of Your Own Craft: The personal achievement of refining your teaching practice through continuous professional development, reflection, and collaboration, becoming a master educator over time.</p>
<h4>TEACHING METHODS</h4>
<p><br>1. Direct Instruction (Teacher-Centered)
This is a structured, explicit teaching method where the teacher presents information in a clear, concise way, often through lectures, demonstrations, or explicit modeling of a skill. It is highly effective for introducing new concepts, providing foundational knowledge, and ensuring efficiency in covering specific material. For example, you would use this to demonstrate how to solve a quadratic equation or explain the causes of a historical event before moving to more interactive activities.

    <li>avoid indiscipline</li>
    <li>come to school early</li>
    <li>respect everyone</li>
<br>2.Inquiry-Based Learning (Student-Centered)
This method flips the script by posing questions, problems, or scenarios rather than simply presenting facts. Students explore, investigate, and discover answers for themselves, which fosters critical thinking, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation. You might achieve this through guided research projects, science experiments, or Socratic seminars where students drive the discussion through their own questions.

<br>3. Cooperative Learning (Collaborative)
This strategy involves students working together in small groups on a structured task to achieve a common goal. It is designed to develop not only academic knowledge but also crucial social skills like communication, leadership, and teamwork. Techniques include "Think-Pair-Share," group projects, and "Jigsaw" activities where each student becomes an expert on one piece of a topic and teaches it to their groupmates.

<br>4. Differentiated Instruction (Adaptive)
This is not a single method but a philosophical approach to teaching where you proactively plan and adapt your instruction to meet the varying interests, readiness levels, and learning profiles (auditory, visual, kinesthetic) within your classroom. This means providing different content, process, product, or learning environment options to ensure all students can access the material and demonstrate their understanding effectively.
<ul>
    <li>clean every classroom</li>
    <li>everyone to be clean</li>
<br>5. Flipped Classroom (Blended)
In this model, the traditional classroom structure is inverted [2]. Students are first exposed to new material outside of class, often through short video lectures (created by you) or readings. Class time is then freed up for hands-on activities, problem-solving, discussions, and personalized help, transforming the classroom into a dynamic workshop rather than a passive listening space.
<!-- everyone is upto task given -->
<br>6. Demonstrations & Visual-Based Learning (Experiential)
This method leverages visual aids, real-world examples, and live demonstrations to make abstract concepts concrete and understandable. This includes using multimedia presentations, infographics, educational videos, models, and live experiments to cater to visual learners and enhance retention for all students.</p>
